# ParkFinder

ParkFinder is a simple REST application that requests the Natonal Park database from data.gov and displays it to the users. users can search for park and sort the parks based on entry fees and other fields.

On further revision for this appliation, I want to add features where users can search parks based on activities they wanna do and also filter the parks by a radius / best time to visit the park.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.1.2 and the api calls are made using node server and axios request module.

Node Version : 12.13.0

## Running the Applicaton

You can follow the following steps to run the application on your local server :
  * npm install 
  * npm run server ( this starts the node server on port 8088 )
  * npm start (this starts the angular development server which proxys port 8088 to make http calls locally )
  * You can preview the application on localhost:4200.
